# machine_learning
  One of the best things about machine learning algorithms is that they can figure out how to perform important tasks by generalizing from examples. It is not easy to construct a deterministic algorithm for task like Natural Language Processing, Image Recognition, Speech Recognition,etc. For all these kind of complex tasks, machine learning is often the feasible and cost effective solution.
